Professional full‑stack engineer focused on building highly scalable systems and integrating blockchain and advanced AI solutions to solve real-world problems. I blend strong engineering fundamentals with practical product-minded delivery — from low-latency Java services and container orchestration to smart contracts and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) agents.

## What I do

- Design and implement resilient, high-performance backend systems using Java and Node.js.
- Build and orchestrate containerized services with Docker and Kubernetes for production-scale deployments.
- Architect blockchain-enabled systems and smart contracts on Ethereum, Polygon, and Corda.
- Develop AI-powered conversational systems and multi-agent frameworks using LangChain and RAG patterns.
- Integrate modern frontend frameworks (React, Tailwind, Material UI) to deliver polished user experiences.

## Core Skills

- Backend: Java, Node.js, RESTful APIs, Microservices, Caching, Load Balancing
- DevOps / Infra: Docker, Kubernetes, CI/CD, Observability, Cloud deployments
- Blockchain: Smart Contracts, Ethereum, Polygon, Corda, Transaction Optimization
- AI / ML: LangChain, RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), Multi-Agent Systems, Conversational AI
- Frontend: React, Redux, Tailwind CSS, Material UI
- Cloud & DB: Firebase, relational and NoSQL databases
- Tools & Languages: Python, JavaScript, Shell, Dockerfile, Git

## Select Projects

- Intelchatbot — Intelligent conversational agent
  - Repo: https://github.com/abheaks/Intelchatbot
  - Tech & highlights: Primarily Python with supporting frontend (JS/HTML/CSS) and container tooling (Dockerfile). Implements RAG-style retrieval, LangChain orchestration, and production-ready deployment scripts. A practical demonstration of multi-agent/agent-based conversational patterns and integrations.
  - Why it matters: Shows end-to-end AI chatbot architecture — retrieval, context management, agent workflows, and deployment automation.

- GayuX — AI agent assistant (multi-agent, mobile-ready, RAG-enabled)
  - Repo: https://github.com/abheaks/GayuX
  - Tech & highlights: Python-first project with supporting JavaScript and CSS. GayuX is designed as a flexible AI agent that can act as your assistant to perform multi-level tasks through agent orchestration.
    - Mobile connectivity: Can be connected to mobile clients (APIs/webhooks) for on-the-go usage.
    - Backend reuse: Designed to reuse and extend existing backend services and APIs — making integration into product stacks straightforward.
    - Document ingestion & RAG: Accepts documents and data feeds to build Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) indexes, so the agent can answer context-rich, domain-specific questions.
    - Agentic web search: Incorporates agentic web search capabilities to gather fresh information from the web as part of its decision-making.
    - Multi-agent orchestration: Can run multi-agent workflows to decompose and coordinate tasks at multiple levels, enabling complex, autonomous task execution.
  - Why it matters: Demonstrates a production-minded AI assistant architecture — bridging mobile clients, reusable backend components, document-driven RAG, and agentic orchestration for practical automation and productivity.

If you'd like a deeper breakdown of any project (architecture diagrams, tech decisions, sample code), I can expand the project section with specific highlights and architecture summaries.

## Experience & Impact

- Built and scaled Java-based backend services for production usage — optimized for reliability and throughput.
- Implemented blockchain smart contracts and integrated them into business processes for tamper-evident workflows and transparent transactions.
- Delivered AI/ML-driven chatbots and multi-agent systems that improve automation, reduce manual intervention, and surface contextual insights.
- Strong track record of shipping robust systems for startups and enterprise contexts.

## How I work

- Aim for pragmatic architectures: choose the right abstraction, not the fanciest one.
- Prioritize observability: metrics, logging, tracing from day one.
- Automate repetitive tasks; codify deployments and rollbacks.
- Build secure-by-design solutions, especially when integrating finance or blockchain components.
